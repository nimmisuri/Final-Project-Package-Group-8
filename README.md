# Final-Project-Package-Group-8

We have created a software development plan for our web application idea. We have a folder called Presentations which includes our midterm presentation and our final presentation, both highlighting different aspects of our project. The docs folder has our SRS, SAS, and project proposal documents included. We have corrected and uploaded a new SRS document. Our mockup folder has screenshots of what our website would look like in real time, once implemented. This project was done by Aaliyah Brown, Talia Berler, and Nimmi Suri
